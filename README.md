# Killer-Sudoku-Solver

This project serves as my AI Capstone Final Project. For our project, we were given creative freedom to choose any AI related problem to work on. I decided to create an AI algorithm that solves the **"Killer Sudoku"** Sudoku variant.

## Description

This project implements an efficient backtracking algorithm to solve Killer Sudoku puzzles and evaluates its performance by solving multiple boards. By focusing on the backtracking approach, this project explores a widely applicable technique for constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) and compares its effectiveness with insights from related research.

This project was inspired by the work of Inês Lynce and João Marques-Silva in *"A Hybrid Approach for the Sudoku Problem: Using Constraint Programming in Iterated Local Search"*. Their study combined constraint programming **(CP)** with iterative local search **(ILS)**, demonstrating the benefits of hybrid methods for solving highly constrained problems like Sudoku. 

While this project focuses solely on backtracking, it incorporates elements of CP, such as forward checking and constraint pruning, to enhance performance while solving a more advanced version of Sudoku.
